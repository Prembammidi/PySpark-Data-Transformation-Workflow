# PySpark-Data-Transformation-Workflow



## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for processing and transforming data using PySpark. It focuses on:
- Loading data from CSV and Parquet formats.
- Performing data transformations using PySpark functions and window operations.
- Creating a structured and modular pipeline for efficient data processing.

The code is designed to handle data transformations, including generating date columns, calculating sequential relationships (e.g., next product), and supporting large datasets.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Data Source Support**: Easily load data from multiple formats (CSV, Parquet).
- **Date Transformation**: Combines `Year`, `Month`, and `Day` columns into a single `Date` column.
- **Window Functions**: Leverages PySparkâ€™s `Window` functions to compute sequential relationships like `Next_Product`.
- **Modular Design**: Encapsulates logic into reusable classes (`DataSource`, `Transformer`, `Workflow`).
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets with PySpark optimizations.
- **Error Handling**: Includes validation to handle unsupported file formats.

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed data processing framework.
- **PySpark**: Python API for Apache Spark.
- **Databricks**: For running and testing the PySpark workflows (optional).
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Git**: Version control for project management.

## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or above
- Apache Spark 3.0 or above
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pyspark-data-transformation.git
   cd pyspark-data-transformation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up Apache Spark (if running locally):
   - [Install Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).
   - Set environment variables: `SPARK_HOME` and `PATH`.

---

## Usage
1. **Run the Workflow:**
   Open the `workflow` notebook and execute the cells to process the data pipeline.

2. **Input Data:**
   - Place your input CSV or Parquet files in the `data/` folder.
   - Update the file path in the workflow.

3. **Output:**
   The transformed DataFrame will include:
   - A `Date` column combining `Year`, `Month`, and `Day`.
   - A `Next_Product` column indicating the next product for the same `Model_ID`.

## Code Walkthrough
### 1. Data Source
- The `DataSource` class provides an abstraction for reading input data.
- Supports CSV and Parquet formats via `csvDataSource` and `ParquetDataSource` subclasses.

### 2. Transformer
- The `firsttransformer` class applies transformations:
  - Combines `Year`, `Month`, and `Day` columns into a `Date` column.
  - Calculates the `Next_Product` using PySpark's `Window` and `lead` functions.

### 3. Workflow
- Orchestrates the data pipeline.
- Loads data, applies transformations, and displays the results.

## Future Enhancements
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Extend support to handle streaming data with Spark Structured Streaming.
- **Additional Data Formats**: Add support for JSON and Avro data sources.
- **Unit Testing**: Implement unit tests to validate transformations.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Include caching and partitioning for large datasets.
